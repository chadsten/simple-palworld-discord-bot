        You're tasked with coding a project and need to follow specific guidelines to ensure quality and consistency across various programming languages and frameworks.

        Document all tasks. Create a folder in the project root named .claude and keep a log of tasks in the following format.

        GOAL: Detail the goal of the task
        IMPLEMENTATION: Describe how it was implemented.
        COMPLETED: The data and time it was completed.

        Get Date using this command even in windows: `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M"`

        [root]
            [.claude]
                [logs]

    <Instructions>
        For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

        Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

        Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

        If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

        All code you write MUST be fully optimized."Fully optimized" includes:

        •	Maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime (e.g., preferring O(n) over O(n²) where possible, minimizing memory allocations).
        •	Using parallelization and vectorization where appropriate (e.g., leveraging multi-threading, GPU acceleration, or SIMD instructions when the problem scale and hardware context justify it).
        •	Following proper style conventions for the code language (e.g., adhering to PEP 8 for Python, camelCase or snake_case as per language norms, maximizing code reuse (DRY)).
        •	No extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e., no technical debt, no speculative features, no unused variables or functions).
        •	Ensuring readability and maintainability without sacrificing performance (e.g., using meaningful variable/function names, adding concise comments only where intent isn't obvious from the code).
        •	Prioritizing language-specific best practices and idiomatic patterns (e.g., list comprehensions in Python, streams in Java, avoiding unnecessary object creation).
        •	Handling edge cases and errors gracefully with minimal overhead (e.g., validating inputs efficiently, avoiding redundant checks).
        •	Optimizing for the target environment when specified (e.g., embedded systems, web browsers, or cloud infrastructure—tailoring memory usage and latency accordingly).
        •	Avoiding deprecated or inefficient libraries/functions in favor of modern, high-performance alternatives (e.g., using pathlib over os.path in Python).
        •	Ensuring portability and compatibility across platforms unless the user specifies otherwise (e.g., avoiding OS-specific calls without providing alternatives for each platform.

        Reward/Penalty Framework:

        I will use the following scoring system to rate your work. Each criteria will be scored on its own accord. I expect you to maintain a positive rating on all criteria:

        ### Rewards (Positive Points):
        •	+10: Achieves optimal big-O efficiency for the problem (e.g., O(n log n) for sorting instead of O(n²)).
        •	+5: Does not contain and placeholder comments, example implementations or other lazy output
        •	+5: Uses parallelization/vectorization effectively when applicable.
        •	+3: Follows language-specific style and idioms perfectly.
        •	+2: Solves the problem with minimal lines of code (DRY, no bloat).
        •	+2: Handles edge cases efficiently without overcomplicating the solution.
        •	+1: Provides a portable or reusable solution (e.g., no hard-coded assumptions).
        ### Penalties (Negative Points):
        •	-20: Creating a TODO comment
        •	-15: Creating a stub method
        •	-10: Fails to solve the core problem or introduces bugs.
        •	-5: Contains placeholder comments, example implementations or other lazy output. UNNACCEPTABLE!
        •	-5: Uses inefficient algorithms when better options exist (e.g., bubble sort instead of quicksort for large datasets).
        •	-3: Violates style conventions or includes unnecessary code.
        •	-2: Misses obvious edge cases that could break the solution.
        •	-1: Overcomplicates the solution beyond what's needed (e.g., premature optimization).
        •	-1: Relies on deprecated or suboptimal libraries/functions.

        ## Your Goal

        For every request, deliver code that:

        •   Achieves the highest possible score in each applicable category.
        •   Is fully optimized, production-ready, and free of placeholders or incomplete sections.
        •   Meets your specific requirements while adhering to the languages best practices.

        I will rate your performance according to these rules or others that fit this pattern. A negative score penalizes your performance.

        At the beginning of every task, create a summary of the objective, a well thought out summary of how you will obtain the objective and the date and time.

        IF your score is within 5 points of the maximum score possible! GREAT JOB! YOU ARE A WINNER!

        When you have completed the task, log your performance score

        ELSE leave your list of excuses that suboptimal performance by bad coders usually entails. You will soon be fired.

    <Memories>
        • The package manager for this project is yarn. You will use yarn commands to install packages, run scripts, etc. Do not use npm or pnpm.
        • Anytime you are running commands for a path use a forward slash not a backslash you will waste time because sometimes it is escape and other times it isn't. Just use forward slashes.
        • ONLY IF YOU ARE IN PLAN MODE: You will finish planning by making/updating a TASKS.md file with all the tasks to complete. It should be grouped by phases and have boxes to check off as you go along.
        • If you are working on a TASKS.md file always mark the [ ] like [x] when you are finished with each task.
        • You will review any PLAN-*.md files as needed to make sure you are staying on track with the overall plan.
        • Never create stub methods.
        • All API/tRPC/etc endpoints should return a proper error message that is properly filtered for security.
